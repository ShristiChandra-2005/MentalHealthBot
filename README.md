# 🧠 MentalHealthBot – AI for Emotional Support

> **A smart AI-powered chatbot web application that identifies signs of emotional distress—such as stress, anxiety, or depression—through natural language processing (NLP), offers self-help resources, and sends alerts in critical cases to promote mental well-being.**

---

##  Motivation

Mental health remains a critical yet neglected issue, especially in rural areas and among teenagers. Many individuals silently suffer due to stigma, lack of awareness, or limited access to professional care. **MentalHealthBot** is a proactive solution to this challenge. It empowers users with a safe space to express their feelings, identify emotional issues early, and receive personalized support through AI.

##  Problem Statement

In India and globally, mental health support is underutilized due to:
- Lack of accessible mental health infrastructure
- Social stigma and fear of judgment
- Inability to recognize early warning signs
- Shortage of psychologists and counselors

This leads to increased rates of school dropouts, self-harm, poor work performance, and long-term psychological disorders.

- **Detects** early signs of emotional distress using NLP
- **Responds** empathetically with helpful mental health resources
- **Alerts** support systems in critical/emergency cases
- **Maintains** complete user anonymity and privacy
